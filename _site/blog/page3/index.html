##Hardware Side
The improvements are required for a more flexible and secure purposes of the sensor node. Previously, the cheap solution was to use the Atmel mega 328p as the centre MCU with just 32K programming memary and 2k SRAM. For the crypto engine, the quarz frequency should be raised to a certain amount which now is 32MHz and with 384kB programming memory Atmel chip XMEGA384C3. The 64-pin TQFP package was again used for this MCU chip as the design size scale.
The basic design in draft is presented below:</p>

<p><img src="/TempBlogs/img/pictures/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-23%20at%2015.17.31.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>The new schematic of PCB is complated according to the reference design from offical Atmel Xmega C series manual. There are few things different which only fit into the modular application solution Nquiringminds demands.</p>

<p>#####The printing 3D box
There are many changes to previous design, basically the cube design is now transfer to the all stackable design instead. The issue is quite complicated with the cube design as there is a risk putting all the modules together along with the power module as well as RF module. The spacing could be the sensitive issue in terms of the attenna and the battery which should go beneath the main MCU module.
The design thinking of this modular sensor node had been changed a lot in terms of the usability and different senarios. The image below shows the brief magenetic connection between each identical sensor boxes which could stack together.</p>

<p>##Software Side
The simple HTTP RESTful server is about to be finished but a lot more are to be modified. There is a failure to add the user athorization on top of the visualization sensor data. It is believed that the issue is happened because of users holding the mongodb collection. Currently, the data sent from each sensor node through the hub stations are storeed in the mongodb using embedded documents with arrays:</p>

<p><img src="/TempBlogs/img/pictures/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-23%20at%2015.32.57.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>The things are to be working on following weeks:</p>

<ul>
<li>The dissertation writting</li>
<li>The further development of software side for the HTTP RESTful server</li>
<li>The hardware design is finished for complating the MSc project</li>
<li>For the company, the hardware design needs to be continued with more researches on voltage regulators and finish the PCB routing.</li>
</ul>

          <p>#Summary for WEEK6
##Software Side
Because of waiting the manufacture delivering the PCB, there is no design actually related to hardware expect for the discussions on the final products. In order to build a flexible solution for most of the cases the company is going to work on, the main MCU board keeps simple but complicated with different tiny components. For example, the voltage regulator or the battery charger just in case the application solution needs different output voltage for the sensors. The &quot;LEGO&quot; design is believed to be like a extendable pcb board with four sides or maybe to form as a cube with 6 faces.
The software side didn&#39;t go well because of not succeeding on streaming the data like a &quot;server awareness&quot; system. The solution was to simply put a AJAX funciton which does the refresh automatically for every 5 second.
The difficulty was mainly the data model, the design is basically as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="/TempBlogs/img/pictures/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-23%20at%2016.29.16.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>Feed data is generally the data for each different sensor station while the node data is for each different sensors. The idea is that data is stored in nested documents and arrays as JSON format. The users&#39; authetication information would be added on top of this.</p>

##Hardware Side
Finalize the design of sensor node PCB on the basis of saving power and price optimization. The Gerber file has been sent to the manufacturer for printing the PCB on Thursday. The simple flexible power management PCb was also finished designing the schematic as well as the PCB routing. In the next week, there is not much  practice work but wait for the PCB arriving and try to lean Sketchup for building the plastic box contaning the sensor nodes with the 3D printer in the purpose of creating the electronic LEGO IOT node.</p>

<p>##Software Side
For the software side, the simple server was researched with serveral existing IOT hobbist and commercial IOT plarform. Among all the platforms, Thinkspeak and plotly, Xively were deeply researched and compared with the connection solutions. Instead of the direct connectiong with the database and MCU which is the sensor nodes placed among the &quot;smart city&quot; under a WI-FI environment, RF tranceivers are used for communicating with two identical MCU board. The other MCU which is not managing the various of sensors would be connect to a Raspberry PI as a main station which is called a Hub. Normally, the connection is through simple serial port for a easier and faster communication solution. However, there are existing solutions of some RF modules which needs the serial port communication with MCU as well. As a result, SPI and I2C are being considered to becoming the alternative ways of PI talking to MCU.</p>

<p>Thus, the important bits are to be done next weeks are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hardware side:

<ul>
<li>Research on how to communicate wi the MCU and Raspberry PI without the serial port(including hte software serial)</li>
<li>Soldering the PCb if arrived</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Software Side:

<ul>
<li>More research on how normally the data is sent to the server more</li>
<li>Understanding the make the comparisons between different framework regarding restful (Express, restify)</li>
<li>Try to build the streaming data plot on top of the previous simple server response from Mongodb stores the sensor readings from Arduino/Moteino</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
