<h1 id="summary-for-week-4">Summary For WEEK 4</h1>

<p>This week, the Moteino experiment was succeed transferring data through rfm69 offered by HOPERF within a small range, and data could be uploaded to web server provided by Nquiringminds with the driver developed for each different sensor. Followingly, the main tasks are experimenting the PCB previously designed on the breadboard and print the PCB for further testing. The MCU and RF module are to be changed through more research regarding different application solutions. It is believed the design of PCB should be fairly quick after the basic PCB design is succeed.</p>

<p>The report is to be started with background and literature review, here are something occured that could be involved in the report.</p>

<h5 id="what-could-possibly-go-in-background">What could possibly go in Background</h5>

<ul>
  <li>General IOT background for generic purpose</li>
  <li>mode detailed proposals for IOT nodes in terms of the hardware issues</li>
  <li>In terms of the business purpose, the price as well as the scale of each IOT nodes should be optimized</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="what-could-be-in-literature-review">what could be in literature review</h5>

<ul>
  <li>The exising solutions like Arduino, Moteino</li>
  <li>the comparisons between each MCUs solutions</li>
  <li>the comparisons between each RF modules solutions</li>
  <li>what problem solved
    <ul>
      <li>modularization</li>
      <li>price/size optimizaton</li>
      <li>secure authentication</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the comparisons between different connection: SPI, I2C, UART</li>
  <li>the comparisons between each different solution of secure the MCU node</li>
  <li>any modulazed solutions like little bits but not price optimized</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="thus-the-certain-things-are-to-be-done-in-the-following-week">Thus, the certain things are to be done in the following week:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>continue on designing the PCB in order to finish the project</li>
  <li>Testing the design see if it could be successful</li>
  <li>try to build the simple data upload server based on previous CMS system which was developed from the basic blog system</li>
  <li>The literature review and background should be drafted before Wednesday in terms of the report</li>
</ul>
